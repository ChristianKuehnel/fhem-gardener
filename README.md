# fhem-gardener
Device for FHEM to monitor the status of plants (in combination with a Xiaomi Mi plant sensor).

It checks the moisture and conductivity levels reported by the sensors and send an email i
f the levels are too low. 
It also monitors the battery level of the sensor and sends an email if the battery is low.

# Installation

To install the software you will need several Perl modules. The fhem module itself can be 
installed via the fhem online update feature.

## Requirements
On Alpine Linux install these packages to be able to compile the Perl modules:
```
apk add perl-datetime gcc perl-dev musl-dev
```
On other distributions install the similar packages.

Install the required Perl modules via cpan:
```
cpan -T DateTime DateTime::Format::Strptime List::Util
```

A personal comment on the used Perl modules:
I am well aware that this introduces A LOT of dependencies and not everyone wants to 
have the full build tool chain on their home automation system.
But I simply refuse to implement the parsing of time stamps or a max function myself.
If you know any library that can do the same thing as DateTime::Format::Strptime and 
List::Utils and have fewer dependencies, I'm happy to use those...


## Adding update site
For an automatic installation and updates of this project run these commands in fhem:
```
update add http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristianKuehnel/fhem-gardener/master/update/controls_gardener.txt
update all
```
Note: the URL must start http, not https.

## Configuration
Define the devie in fhem with:
```
define <some_name> Gardener
```
If there are any problems check the fhem logs, usually some Perl modules are missing.

After that you can configure the modules with several attributes (see fhem command reference after installation). 

# Getting the data

The Xiaomi MI plant sensors are using Bluetooth Low Energy have have a range of about 5 meters.
So if your home automation server is further away than that, you will need some proxy for this.
For this use case I implemented the [plantgateway](https://github.com/ChristianKuehnel/plantgateway).
